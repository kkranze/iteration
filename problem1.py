#Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 1000. But for multiples of
#three print "Burrito" instead of the number and for the multiples of five
#print "Cheeto ". Finally For numbers that are multiples of seven, print
#"Veto". For numbers which are multiples of three and seven print
#"BurritoCheeto". For numbers of five and seven print "CheetoVeto"
#For numbers which are multiples of both three and five and seven print
#"BurritoCheetoVeto".
